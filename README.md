# Goat Origins (Rammling)
This is an mobility focused addon to the origins mod which will allow you to play as a rammling, a mysterious race of goat people. It requires Origins and Fabric Api. I suggest using the CurseForge app to download this, but it can also be downloaded at its [CurseForge Page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/goat-origins-rammling)
